# Verification: dist/ is properly ignored

This file documents the verification performed for Issue #919.

## Verification Steps

1. Checked tracked files:
   ```bash
   git ls-files link-crawler/dist/
   # Result: No output (no files tracked)
   ```

2. Built the project:
   ```bash
   cd link-crawler && bun run build
   # Result: dist/crawl.js generated successfully
   ```

3. Verified git status:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Result: dist/ directory not shown (properly ignored)
   ```

## Conclusion
The .gitignore configuration is working correctly.
- link-crawler/.gitignore contains: `dist/`
- Root .gitignore contains: `dist/`
- Build artifacts in dist/ are properly ignored by git

Issue #919 requirements are satisfied.
