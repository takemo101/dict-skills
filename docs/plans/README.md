# Plans Directory

This directory contains implementation plans for GitHub Issues.

## Structure
- Plan files are named `issue-{number}-plan.md`
- Plan files are automatically generated and should not be committed to Git
- Only this README.md is tracked in version control

## Usage
Plans are created by the pi-issue-runner workflow and are cleaned up after PR merge.
